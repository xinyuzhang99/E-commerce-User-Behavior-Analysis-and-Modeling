# E-commerce-User-Behavior-Analysis-and-Modeling

Regarding the business of e-commerce platforms, every decision takes much financial and human resource costs. It is of great importance to understand how to drive their sales effectively. However, with the vast amount of user data, extracting useful information and discovering what factors influence customers’ shopping habits pose significant challenges. This project introduces a data-driven pipeline that employs data mining techniques to process, analyze, and predict customer behavior. Experimental data was collected from Alibaba and contains customer behavior on the website Taobao over two weeks in 2017. The pipeline starts with data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis with visualizations. Then, customer segmentation based on RFM analysis and K-means clustering is implemented to divide customers into groups through their historical behavior. Finally, each user’s behavior sequence is modeled by recurrent neural network (RNN) and its variant LSTM. The trained models can perform user behavior forecasting. This comprehensive approach can help the platform to gain valuable insights into their customer, leading to making more informed and cost-effective business decisions.

## Dataset
The original dataset is [User Behavior Data from Taobao for Recommendation](https://tianchi.aliyun.com/dataset/649) from Alibaba. 
Due to the large dataset size, the original dataset and processed datasets are uploaded and can be accessed on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OXTEbrnN_HypkcQcYYkCjugKQmtfo15E?usp=sharing).
